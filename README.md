# nanolife

Nanolife is an exploration project to create life that can grow and learn.

## Life
A Life is just a 2D structure composed of blocks (that will be displayed as pixels of different colors).

A Life can and must do many things:

* It must feed or die
* It can grow with enough food
* It can send spawns with enough food
* It can move
* It can sense its surroundings (food or other Life)
* It can attack its surrounding to diminish their size
* It can feed on other Life at least twice as small as itself
